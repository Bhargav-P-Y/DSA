Is the solution of the current problem based on the solution of smaller problems?
Start with a simple recursive solution
Solve the current piece and recurse with the samller portion

In the recursive approach or we recalculating things?
Memoize it in a array, hashmap or 2D table

Are we using too much space?

Try from the ground up, the base case
Then build up through iteration
