/*
Recursive Flow Breakdown
Letâ€™s say your list is: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ nullptr

Now walk through the recursion:

Initial call: reverseList(1)

head = 1

newHead = 1 (temporary)

Calls reverseList(2)

Second call: reverseList(2)

head = 2

newHead = 2 (temporary)

Calls reverseList(3)

Third call: reverseList(3)

head = 3

newHead = 3 (temporary)

Calls reverseList(4)

Fourth call: reverseList(4)

head = 4

newHead = 4 (temporary)

head->next == nullptr, so recursion ends here

Returns newHead = 4

ðŸ”„ Backtracking Phase (Where Reversal Happens)
Now we go back up the call stack:

In the third call (head = 3):

newHead = reverseList(4) â†’ newHead = 4

head->next->next = head â†’ 4->next = 3

head->next = nullptr â†’ 3->next = nullptr

Returns newHead = 4

In the second call (head = 2):

newHead = reverseList(3) â†’ newHead = 4

3->next = 2, 2->next = nullptr

Returns newHead = 4

In the first call (head = 1):

newHead = reverseList(2) â†’ newHead = 4

2->next = 1, 1->next = nullptr

Returns newHead = 4
