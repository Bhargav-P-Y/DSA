Reversing doubly linked list
Reverse next pointers --> Left to right 
then reverse prev pointer --> Right to left

Are we doing redundant work?
If yes, these can help avoid it

Hashing
Two Pointers [Slow (where you are now) Fast (where you want to be)]
              Learn -> Ppl better than you, Teach --> You are better than them
Sliding Window
Precompute --> Prepare beforehand
Dynamic programming

Check if something is feasible before doing something
If a path is wrong --> Backtrack
Store variables instead of repeatedly scanning stuff

Have a goal?
Work backwards from it!

Too hard?
Make it easier, make it smaller -> Recursion

Have tasks to do?
Start with the longest task -> Let it run in the background
Then start with the next longer
Reorder them so you wait less
