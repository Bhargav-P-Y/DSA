Reversing doubly linked list
Reverse next pointers --> Left to right 
then reverse prev pointer --> Right to left

Are we doing redundant work?
If yes, these can help avoid it

Hashing
Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Precompute --> Prepare beforehand
Dynamic programming

Check if something is feasible before doing something [Recursion etc]
Store variables instead of repeatedly scanning stuff

Have a goal?
Work backwards from it!
